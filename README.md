## Learnt the following:

1. Covered how to create variables using var and assign the value such as Int, Double, String, Boolean. (Swift's type inference).
2. Usage of thousand separator using underscores. For example: 8_00_000, this will be equal to 800000 in Int value.
3. If the string is to be multiple lines, use triple quotes """  """ (Note: triple quotes should be in its own line & if you want to avoid new line in output use \ EOF line).
4. Constants using let
5. String Interpolation - using variables in the strings
6. Explicit Type annotation and Swift automatic type inference.
